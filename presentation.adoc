--
A way to couple xml with java source code,
so a view with UI logics
(Does not have to have a view)

=== Fragment life-cycle

[background-color="aquamarine"]
=== Advantages of Fragments

* Fragments are more reusable than views
* Basically a small activity
* Good to use when working on tablet compatible apps

[background-color="aquamarine"]
=== Use cases for fragments

* If you have a feature that can be reused (aka. Progress Bars)

[background-color="aquamarine"]
=== Why fragments shouldn't be overused

* Backstack of the fragments in navigation is complicated
* Support library updates may cause new and unexpected ways for fragments to behave.
* Testing an app with a lot of fragments is a pain for bug fixing.

== (Recycler) View

--
All about efficiency
--

[background-color="aquamarine"]
=== How does it work?

1. Works with the adapter interface
2. Asks adapter how many items there are
3. Asks adapter for a viewHolder and draws the item in the viewHolder

[background-color="aquamarine"]
=== Advantages of Recycler view

* Designed to be efficient
* Layout is easily customizable and can be shown in many ways
* Is reusing as much as it can, making the app more efficient
* more efficient sibling of list- and gridview

== (Content) Provider

[background-color="aquamarine"]
=== What is a (Content) Provider
--
A class that sits between an app and it's data source, which provides managed
access to the abstract data.
--
=== What does it do?
--
It can grab or write data to a users contacts, documents or calendar for example

[background-color="aquamarine"]
=== Advantages

* It is abstract from the other data sources.
* Leverage functionality of Android Classes (ex. Loaders)
* Allow many apps to access, use and modify a single data source securely

[background-color="aquamarine"]
=== How do you set your Provider?

--
*With a Content-Resolver*
